# Albedo
A Philips hue application for the Windows Desktop.

Originally published by http://loginer.net/albedo however the original developer seems to be no longer working on it so I have decided to fork the repository and try to fix the issues with it preventing it from being able to see the bulbs and scenes from the Bridge.
