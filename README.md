# Albedo
A Philips hue application for the Windows Desktop.

Sits neatly in the system tray allowing you to quickly get to your Philips Hue scenes from your Windows PC and has a really nice Windows Modern interface.

Originally published by http://loginer.net/albedo however the original developer seems to be no longer working on it so I have decided to fork the repository and try to fix the issues with it preventing it from being able to see the bulbs and scenes from the Bridge because the look and feel of the application was exactly what I wanted from a Philips Hue desktop application.
